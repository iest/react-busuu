## TODO

- [ ] Add WebAPI util to handle fetching of exercise (init store on recieving raw data from backend)
- [ ] Create Exercise actions to handle everything that happens in an exercise
- [ ] Change all `setState` calls inside `RecordingExercise.react` to be handled by the Dispatcher and registered callbacks (flux)
- [ ] write up why this is cool


# Notes

- None of the CSS files have been included in this repo, so you'll need to grab them from the main angular repo
- Same with the fonts
