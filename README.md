# Nothing to see here... Move along

...still here?

## TODO

Keeping track of recording:
- Set state of specific script in exercise to done

- [ ] Store state for if they've completed the current script step (made a recording)
- [ ] Get preview stage working


# Notes

- None of the CSS files have been included in this repo, so you'll need to grab them from the main angular repo
- Same with the fonts
